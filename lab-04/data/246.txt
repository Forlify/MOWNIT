i really wanted to like dude , where's my car ? after a week of deadlines , dead time , and dead emotions , i needed a goofy movie to revive me . so , imagine my horror as i sat alone in the cavernous theater , trying to muster a chuckle or a titter . ornery ostriches didn't do the trick . neither did a transsexual stripper , a pot-smoking dog or an appearance by fabio . there is a place for movies like dude , where's my car ? -- national lampoon's
