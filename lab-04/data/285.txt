a combination of coincidence and trend has just brought us at least three new american movies either directed by women and/or with a nearly all-female cast : diane keaton's unstrung heroes , david anspaugh's ( hoosiers ) moonlight and valentino , and , by australian jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , how to make an american quilt . in moonlight and valentino a bunch of relatives and/or friends are trying to support college poetry teacher elizabeth perkins after her ( also academic ) husband is killed in a yuppie accident : a car hits him as he jogs . moonlight and valentino is a would-be tearjerker .
