" my problem was being a young man with money in manhattan , " says bret easton ellis , citing his inspiration for american psycho . when it comes to vivid fantasies of alienated urban narcissism , his prose strikes a chilling , edgy chord . like skimming the surface of an icy lake , we are left imagining the dark depths below . hey , that really sounds poetic ! i'm gonna have another valium before writing the rest of this review -- maybe someday i'll be as glib as ellis ! just kidding . i've actually enjoyed reading ellis' novels of passive emptiness . less than zero is the perfect book for road trips
