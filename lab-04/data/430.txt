monkeybone starring : brendan fraser , bridget fonda , chris kattan , rose mcgowan , megan mullally , voice of john turturro . directed by : henry selick running time : 90 minutes rated pg-13 : crude humor and brief nudity . " from the director of " the nightmare before christmas " it said in the previews , which i'm guessing was said to get people to go see the movie , obviously it hasn't worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million .
