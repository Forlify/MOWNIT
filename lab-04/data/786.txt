the back of the video box for arachnophobia is deceiving . it markets itself as a horror movie with a comedic side and it's anything but that . what begins as a cool idea for a horror movie ( out in the tropical rainforest ) trying to find old species of spiders and other creepy crawlies ( ok , i admit that word is extremely hokey . ) but once the film gets off to it's interesting start , and the story is set up , it's all down hill from there .
