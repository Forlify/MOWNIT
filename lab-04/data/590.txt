it would be easy to miss the point of a film like 'hurlyburly' . that is if it had one . i've been a movie critic for 15 years and i don't think i've ever seen a more pointless film that rambles on and on and on like a broken record and when it's over , it's no closer to having said anything in its final 10 minutes than in its opening running time of the same length . set in hollywood hills , eddie and mickey
