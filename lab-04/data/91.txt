director : carl schenkel || screenplay : bayard johnson and j . anderson black || stars : casper van dien ( tarzan ) , jane march ( jane porter ) , steven waddington ( nigel ravens ) || mpaa rating : pg " tarzan and the lost city " is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . not only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . unfortunately , it's not bad in the way great
