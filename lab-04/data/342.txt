while the film world awaits what sounds like a daring experiment from director richard linklater -- the animated waking life , coming in october -- the filmmaker attempts to hold us over with tape , a failure of a low-budget project if ever there was one . the movie is shot on video and confined to a single motel room , for the entirety of its real-time , 84-minute length . with such restrictive parameters self-imposed on a feature , success really must lie in creative direction , acting power , and a solid screenplay .
