'runaway bride' is such a bad film that it's difficult to know where to begin . the poster for it certainly made it look like it was more interested in showing the physical attributes of its stars rather than their talents . their smiles , their smirks , their way with each other that was all seen in 1990's 'pretty woman' . the mismatched man and woman who dislike each other at first but later fall in love in such an unconvincing manner that not only is it an insult to the audiences intelligence
