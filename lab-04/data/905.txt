it seems that david lynch's adaptation of frank herbert's epic science fiction novel dune ( 1984 ) wasn't enough to convince people that this classic works far better on the page . at least that box office fiasco packs in some interesting lynchian perversions . besides , how can you go wrong with a cast that includes patrick stewart , max von sydow , and alicia witt as a bald , pint-sized , knife-wielding child ? let me tell you something , buddy -- you can't top that ! maybe it ain't herbert's vision of dune , but it's fun
