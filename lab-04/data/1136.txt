throw some shots of a vaguely menacing fetus over the opening credits , toss in a brash score by bernard hermann , and you're off and running . is the baby gonna eat it's way out of the mother ? is there going to be some sort of killer baby run amok , a la some larry cohen flick , in brian de palma's sisters ( now out on dvd ) ? nope . false alarm . this sequence is pretty cool , but we don't have a mutant killer baby slashing up
