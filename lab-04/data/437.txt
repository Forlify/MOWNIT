tristar / 1 : 40 / 1998 / r ( language , violence , wasted talent ) cast : michael keaton ; andy garcia ; brian cox ; marcia gay harden ; joseph cross ; erik king ; efrain figueroa director : barbet schroeder screenplay : david klass " desperate measures " is a generic title for a film that's beyond generic . it's also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks
