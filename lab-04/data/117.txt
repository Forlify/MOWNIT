" spawn " may be somewhat of an older film . in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn't seen it will finally get to see it ( that is , if they see it ) . but i managed to catch it before it made it's way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and , god forbid , video cassette purchasing . it wasn't the worst film of year by any means . it isn't even on the top 5 of the worst
