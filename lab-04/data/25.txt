there are some actors that you just look at and will automatically see them as the famous character they play . fran drescher will forever will the nanny , bob denver will always be gilligan , and don knotts lives forever as barney fife . all these people are television actors who appear on their show , week after week playing the same character , so it is hard for this to translate into celebrities who appear in movies . anthony hopkins on the other hand apparently wants us to always think of him as a crazed madman behind bars . this is the only reason i could come up
