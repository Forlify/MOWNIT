anywhere but here ? a more apt title you will not find on a motion picture this decade . after a witty lead like that , at this point in the movie review , i usually launch into a brief plot synopsis . so here goes : a down-to-earth teenage girl hates her crazy mother . if you're waiting for more , you can stop holding your breath . in a nutshell , that's it . sure , there are some details ( the two move from wisconsin to beverly hills ) – okay , there is * a * detail – but someone really tried to make a movie out of this * shocking * premise .
