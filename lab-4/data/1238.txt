starring al franken , laura san giacomo , vincent d'onofrio , and harris yulin . review by laurence mixson ( venom8@hotmail . com ) a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! i didn't really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family . the movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . my real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies
