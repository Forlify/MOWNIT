plot : something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and non-horror movies . oh yeah , there's also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit , but trust me , you won't care much about the " plot " in this film . . . critique : parody movies either work or they don't and this one just doesn't work ! the laughs aren't as pronounced this time around , the energy level , the gags and all of
