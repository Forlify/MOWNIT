capsule : why is this movie three hours long ? because it's too stupid to know when to stop . the postman may be the single dumbest movie i've ever seen . not the worst -- i still leave that accolade to be divided between starship troopers and money train -- but by far the dumbest . it takes a situation that had plenty of possibilities , which are all better examined in the david brin novel that the postman has been sensessly cannibalized from , and turns them into an idiot's delight . people should be able to buy insulin along with their popcorn for this one , it's so saccharine and treacly . not too far
