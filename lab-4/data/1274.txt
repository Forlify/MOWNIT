i'm sure that there is something to behold within the personality and act of the late andy kaufman . but i just don't see it . director milos forman's 1996 bio pick on the life of pornographer larry flynt is a seriously under rated and brilliant film that didn't get the credit it deserved . i never liked larry flynt or the things he did but his right to free speech was and is absolute and although i never liked his lifestyle , i still thought the film about him is a classic and it was my favourite film the year it came
