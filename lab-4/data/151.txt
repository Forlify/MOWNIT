directed by delbert mann written by paddy chayefsky ( from his play ) cast : ernest borgnine , betsy blair , esther minciotti , joe mantell . my favourite film of all time is james mangold's heavy , which i first saw on the day before new year's eve 1995 . heavy is about the life of man who is paralysed by a lack of confidence and starts to slowly awaken when he falls in love with a young waitress . i can attribute my passionate interest in the world of cinema directly to that
