review by lars lindahl ( larsattacks@mail . com ) starring norm macdonald , dave chapelle , elaine stritch , sherman hemsley , daniel benzali , and danny devito the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending . watching one of these movies , everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise . when the film ends , there is a moment of confusion , then recollection , then some more confusion , then possibly a second viewing for clarification . this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more . good surprises make
