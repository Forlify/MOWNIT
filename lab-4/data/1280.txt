the first thing that hit me about " twentyfourseven " was the starkness of the black and white film and the bareness of the sets . that combined with the film's slow pacing and simple plot make the first half of the film feel very long . at the center of " twentyfourseven " is bob hoskins as darcy , a middle-aged man from a relatively rural area in england . although not an obvious leader , darcy finds the motivation within himself to open a boxing club for the local youth . it is his impression that this club , like the one he had as a teen , will restore camaraderie and pride to the troubled lads
