review by lars lindahl ( larsattacks@mail . com ) " double jeopardy " ( 1999 ) tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse . the fugitive ? not quiteâ€¦this is the plot for double jeopardy , another fugitive copycat without the action , excitement , and good acting that the original had . there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good ; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall , clever huh ? oh
