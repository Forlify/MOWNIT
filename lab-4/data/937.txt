how typical ! joel schumacher , who is currently destabilizing , dismantling , and destroying the batman franchise , has taken a different turn , definitely not for the better with his latest effort ( ha ! ) entitled '8mm' . once again schumacher ( who should be relegated to directing t . v . commercials and music videos ) pushes us away instead , and instead of drawing us in , he makes the fatal mistake of handing the audience a movie that has too much literal meaning and not enough space to let the audience digest one course before he crams another down our throats . it would have been a pleasant experience to see this film
