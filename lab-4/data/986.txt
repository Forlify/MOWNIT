loser -a review by bill chambers ( bill@filmfreakcentral . net ) starring jason biggs , mena suvari , greg kinnear written and directed by amy heckerling * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films , director amy heckerling's latest , loser , seesaws between unpleasant and artificial , and is sometimes both at once . when she tackles big issues , such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high , it's impossible to tell whether she's being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) , but whatever the case , she continually refuses to comment
