species ii ( 1998 ) rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . ---------- starring : michael madsen , marg helgenberger , natasha henstridge , justin lazard , james cromwell , george dzundza , mykelti williamson . here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . okay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart
