it is rare that a great actress ( garofalo ) will make two * really * bad movies , back to back . it is even rarer that those two movies will premiere on the same day . and what are the odds that those two films will star brothers ( eg . luke wilson in this movie and owen wilson in the minus man ) ? according to my astrologer/numerologist , it's an 18 billion to one shot . and yet it happened here , when two of the worst films to grace the silver screen have been star-crossed in this conflagration of irony . there's very little worth writing about in dog park .
