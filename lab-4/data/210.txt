in michael corrente's " outside providence " , the first image we see is that of a boy on his bicycle . behind him , tied to his bike with a rope , is a kid in a wheelchair , throwing newspapers to people's houses . tied to the wheelchair is a three-legged dog , limping for his life . we've seen this picture before , now haven't we ? if " we " have seen a film by peter and bobby farrelly , then yes , we have . but then again , the farrelly brothers' three films ( " dumb and dumber " , " kingpin " and " there's something about mary " )
