member of the 'internet movie critics association' http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/studio/5713/index . html what an enigma . it's 89 minutes of my life that i can't get back . i just can't figure out how such a skillful pair of performers like ralph fiennes and uma thurman can let themselves be a part of such a mess like 'the avengers' . even a veteran like sean connery looks awkward in this film and let's face it , has connery had a really good film since 1990's 'the hunt for red october' ?
