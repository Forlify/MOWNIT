starring : keanu reeves , james spader , marisa tomei . when i first saw the previews for joe charbonic's new serial killer thriller , i thought " hey maybe keanu might come out with a somewhat decent movie " . i was somewhat disappointed with " the matrix " though i liked it never-the-less . i went into " the watcher " expecting a somewhat good serial killer flick and walked out with a headache , some confusion and wondering why they wanted to make this movie in the first place . i may be the only one to give this movie this low of a rating
