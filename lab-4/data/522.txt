following one of the most pitiful title sequences i've ever seen , the watcher actually proceeds to become one of the most pitiful thrillers i've ever seen . and that takes some doing . . . but let me tell you how . i give the movie half a point for its mildly eyebrow-raising premise . an l . a . serial killer ( reeves ) has finally worn down the cop who was chasing him ( james spader ) to the point where he can no longer function in society . the cop gives up on the chase after a dozen-plus murders go unsolved , moves to chicago , and tries to drop out of life
